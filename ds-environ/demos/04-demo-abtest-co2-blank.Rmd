## Demo: A/B Testing with Mauna Loa CO₂

> **Goal.** Use the Mauna Loa monthly CO₂ record to run a two‑sided **A/B test** with a **permutation (randomization)** test.  
> **A** = 1960s, **B** = 2010s. Outcome: monthly change Δ ppm. We **block by month‑of‑year** to preserve seasonality.  
> Then tackle a **an in class challenge** on seasonal amplitude (per‑year max−min).

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("tidyverse", quietly = TRUE)

# Helper: data path inside project
path_data <- function(...) file.path("data", ...)

# Set a seed for reproducibility of permutations
set.seed(1)
```

### Import CO₂ monthly data

The file is in `data/co2_mm_mlo.txt` (copied with this Rmd). We skip commented header lines and parse the monthly **average** and **de‑seasonalized** series. In this file, `-9.99` and `-0.99` flag missing metadata.

```{r import}
co2 <- readr::read_table(
    file = path_data("co2_mm_mlo.txt"),
    comment = "#",
    col_names = c("year","month","decimal_date","average","deseasonalized",
                  "ndays","stdev_days","unc_month"),
    na = c("-9.99","-0.99")
  )

glimpse(co2)
```

### Create the outcome and define A/B groups

We compute **Δ ppm** month‑to‑month and subset to the **1960s** and **2010s**. We also keep `month_name` to block permutations by month (preserving seasonality).

```{r construct-ab}
library(dplyr)
co2_delta <- co2 %>%
    arrange(year, month) %>%
    mutate(
      delta = average - dplyr::lag(average),
      decade = floor(year / 10) * 10,
      month_name = month.abb[month]
    )
glimpse(co2_delta)
```


```{r construct-ab2}
### subset to the decades of interest (use filter? base R?) 

co2_ab <- co2_delta %>%
  filter(decade == 2010 | decade == 1960) 

## There should only be two, 2010 and 1960
length(unique(co2_ab$decade)) == 2

co2_ab$group <- ifelse(co2_ab$decade == 1960, "A_1960s", "B_2010s")

table(co2_ab$group)

```

### Observed effect (difference in means)

Our statistic: \(\Delta = \bar{\Delta}_{2010s} - \bar{\Delta}_{1960s}\). Positive values imply faster month‑to‑month increases in the 2010s.

```{r observed-effect}
## calculate the mean delta by group
obs_means <- co2_ab %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  summarize(T_obs = mean(delta))

T_obs <- obs_means$T_obs[obs_means$group == "B_2010s"] - obs_means$T_obs[obs_means$group == "A_1960s"]
                         
names(T_obs) <- "T_obs"
T_obs
```

### Permutation test (two‑sided), **blocked by month**

We permute the **group labels within each month-of-year** to preserve seasonal structure while breaking any decade effect.

```{r perm-test}
perm_once_blocked <- function(df) {
  gp <- df$group
  for (m in unique(df$month_name)) {
    idx <- which(df$month_name == m)
    gp[idx] <- sample(gp[idx], replace = FALSE)
  }
  mean(df$delta[gp == "B_2010s"]) - mean(df$delta[gp == "A_1960s"])
}

nnull <- 5000
T_star <- replicate(nnull, perm_once_blocked(co2_ab))

# Two-sided permutation p-value
p_perm <- mean(abs(T_star) >= abs(T_obs))
p_perm
```

#### Visualize the permutation null

```{r perm-plot, fig.height=4, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tibble(T_star = T_star) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = T_star)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 40, alpha = 0.7) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = T_obs, linetype = 2) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = -T_obs, linetype = 2) +
    labs(title = "Permutation null for Δ (2010s − 1960s), blocked by month",
         x = "Permuted Δ", y = "Count") +
    theme_minimal()

```
What is your conclusion? 
ANSWER... 


#### Sanity check: raw Δ distributions

```{r delta-dists, fig.height=4, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(subset(co2_ab, !is.na(delta)), aes(x = delta, fill = group)) +
    geom_histogram(position = "identity", alpha = 0.5, bins = 30) +
    labs(x = "Monthly change Δ ppm", y = "Count",
         title = "Monthly CO₂ growth: 1960s vs 2010s") +
    theme_minimal()

```

### Challenge Problem — Seasonal amplitude A/B test

**Question.** Is the **seasonal amplitude** (per‑year `max(average) − min(average)`) larger in the **2010s** than in the **1960s**?

**First, make a plan:**
1) Compute yearly amplitudes.  
2) Define A (1960s years) and B (2010s years).  
3) Observed effect: mean(amplitude\_B) − mean(amplitude\_A).  
4) Permutation test at the **year level** by randomly reassigning years to A/B (keeping counts fixed).

```{r challenge}
# Build yearly amplitudes
```


```{r challenge}
# Observed effect
```


```{r challenge}
# Year-level permutation (keeps A/B year counts fixed)

```
