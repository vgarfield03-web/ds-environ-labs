## Demo: Exponential Population Growth (week 2)

> **Learning goals**  
> • Simulate **deterministic exponential growth**.  
> • Explore how **initial size** \(N_0\) and **growth rate** \(r\) shape trajectories.  
> • Compute **doubling time** \(T_d = \ln 2 / r\) and **time to reach a threshold**.  

### Exponential population growth model

Exponential growth assumes the population changes proportionally to its current size:
\[
N_t \;=\; N_0 \, e^{r t},
\]
where \(N_0\) is the initial size and \(r\) is the **per‑time growth rate**.

- **Doubling time:** \(T_d = \dfrac{\ln 2}{r}\) (time until \(N_t\) doubles).  
- **Time to threshold \(N^\*\):** \(t^\* = \dfrac{\ln(N^\*/N_0)}{r}\).

### Simulate & plot a single scenario

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(1)  # reproducibility for optional noise below
```

First we will write a function to compute the population size and time step t. 

```{r function}

calcN <- function(N0, r, t){
  ## This function calculates exponential growth of N, given N0 (initial population), r(growth rate) and t
  N <- N0*exp(r*t)
  return(N)
}
```

Set parameters (tweak live to show effects of **N0** and **r**):

```{r simulate}
N0 <- 50        # initial size
r  <- -0.01      # growth rate per time step
T  <- 50        # number of time steps
t <- 0:T

## use our function to calculate N

N <- calcN(N0=N0, r=r, t=t)

```

Plot the trajectory:

```{r plot-deterministic, fig.height=3.6, fig.width=6}

plot(x=t, y=N, type = "l", main = "Deterministic exponential growth",
        xlab = "Time (t)", ylab = "N_t")

```

Compute **doubling time** directly from `r`:

```{r doubling}

r <- 0.01
log(2)/r 

calcDoublingTime <- function(r){
  double.t <- log(2)/r 
  return(double.t )
}

calcDoublingTime(1.0)

```

Compute **time to threshold** \(N^\* = 10{,}000\) (can change this number to explore different dynamics):

```{r threshold}
N0 <- 50
Nstar <- 10000
r <- 0.1
tstar <- (log(Nstar) - log(N0))/r
tstar

calcTstar <- function(Nstar, N0, r){
  tstar <- (log(Nstar) - log(N0))/r
  return(tstar)
}

calcTstar(Nstar = 10^10, N0 = 1, r = 0.01)

```

---

### Compare two growth rates 

Side‑by‑side curves make the influence of \(r\) obvious.

```{r compare-two, fig.height=3.6, fig.width=6}
r1 <- 0.05
r2 <- 0.10
t  <- 0:T
N1 <- calcN(N0, r1, t)
N2 <- calcN(N0, r2, t)

matplot(t, cbind(N1, N2), type = "b", pch = 1:2, col = 1:2,
          xlab = "Time (t)", ylab = "N_t",
          main = "Exponential growth with two r values")

legend("topleft", legend = c(paste("r =", r1), paste("r =", r2)),
         pch = 1:2, col = 1:2, bty = "n")
```

**Observation.** Small changes in \(r\) cause large differences later in time.

### In class challenge

1) Change `r` to from a number < $-1$ to a number $>$ 1, trying 10 different numbers. HINT: use a for loop.  Describe what the different `r` do to the population dynamics. 


```{r}

```

2) Another type of "population" can grow exponentially is the population of infected individuals. We have a separate model for their growth known as SIR models (susceptible-infected-recovered), but when a infectious disease is first introduced to a population, it grows exponentially because no one is immune (i.e., via getting sick and recovering or getting vaccinated) `r`.  Explore the population trajectory of measles if no one in Eugene were vaccinated, and one infected person was introduced (N0=1). How long would it take for the entire population of  178,786 to be sick? 

```{r}

```
